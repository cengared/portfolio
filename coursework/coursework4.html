<h1>Styling using JavaScript and the DOM</h1>

<p>
Here's a web page with three different coloured squares on it.
</p>
<p>
Use JavaScript (in the form of an external file, or files) so that when a user clicks on one of the coloured
squares below, the background of the whole web page changes to that
colour. You can assume that the coloured squares equate to the named colours
pink, yellow and green.
</p>

<p>
You may alter the html as you see fit, including linking to your
external .js file(s), but the colour changes MUST
happen using JavaScript. I don't mind which way you use JavaScript to
tackle the problem.
</p>
<p>
5 marks for successfully changing the page colours.<br />
Another 5 marks if you can use JavaScript to reset the page to its
original background colour. <br />
Marks are dependent on being able to explain what you've done!
