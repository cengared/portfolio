			This is the report section of this site for use in the assessment.
			</p>
			<p>
			I just wanted to make a simple site, with links to work I have done at the universities 
			I have attended. I wanted it to have a dark background with lighter text so after looking 
			online for a background I chose this one at	<a href="http://www.backgroundlabs.com/item/geometric-tiles-pattern/">backgroundlabs.com</a>
			</p>
			<p>
			For the structure of the site, I quickly made the pages I needed with little content but 
			having the same design for each page. The head element contains meta tags for site description 
			& author name as well as links to a style sheet and a font I like from Google Fonts. I split 
			the body into several divs which are used on all pages - the header div which controls the page's 
			heading (using the linked Google Font), the nav div which holds the main navigation bar which is 
			the same for all pages and the text div makes handling the text over the whole site much easier.
			</p>
			<p>
			Once I had the structure in place with a little bit of temporary content for use as a visual aid 
			I started on creating the main CSS page for the site. This style sheet handles the different font 
			settings for different parts of a page as well as controlling the display of the horizontal navigation 
			bar. Initially I was going to have a page for picking a university to view work from but felt it 
			would be better if both universities have their own page accessible from the menu bar.
			</p>
			<p>
			For each of the university pages I needed a sub menu to cover the different options available on 
			each page. I decided to make this a vertical menu, the display of which is all handled by the main 
			CSS file. I made a button like background for a link with a slightly smaller one with a different 
			coloured border for when the mouse is hovering over the link. One of the pages for my university 
			work has a lot of screenshots and so to display them in a pleasing manner I used CSS that Karsten 
			Seipp showed us during the 7th web programming lecture as a basis then modified it to meet my needs. 
			As this CSS is only used by one page I put it in it’s own file and had the link to it added to just 
			the page it was made for.
			</p>
			<p>
			The next step was to make more style sheets for different browser sizes. Small browsers like on 
			smart phones need bigger text and link buttons, plus the horizontal menu I’ve got doesn’t resize 
			as well as I would like but I can step down the size of it for different browser sizes. Using a 
			combination of viewport in the HTML to get the device width and the @media tag in CSS to have specific 
			style rules dependent on the device size I was able to get the site to display well through different 
			browsers and on different screen sizes.
