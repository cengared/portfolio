			I studied for a degree in Computer Games Programming at Teesside University from 
			2007 to 2010 but only successfully completed the first two years, and was awarded a 
			Diploma of Higher Education as a result.
			</p>
			<p>
			Year 1: In the C++ Programming modules I was learning C++ from stratch, writing code 
			by hand in pseudocode and by using UNIX based text editors and command line compilers. 
			The links below are to .zip files containing the in-course assessments (ICAs) that I 
			did for the modules. The Technical Asset Creation module focused on 3D modelling 
			using Autodesk Maya. The related link is to a YouTube video of the ICA I made.
			</p>
			<p>
			Year 2: I started using Visual Studio 2008 for the modules in this year so the links 
			below contain the appropriate Visual Studio files for each ICA though they probably 
			won't compile in current versions of the program. They also have standalone executables 
			that should still work. In Games Software Development 1 I made a 2D game in C++ using 
			an API created by the course leader. In Games Software Development 2 the task was to make 
			a demo of a 3D game using C# and Microsoft XNA. Windows GUI Programming was about using 
			C# to make applications in the single document interface style (SDI). The ICA was to make 
			a Windows SDI application for a game with a specific rule set.
